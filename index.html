<h1> The Best Movies According to Merencillo </h1>

    <h2> My Top 10 Movies of all-time</h2> <hr/>

    <h3> Sex Education </h3>

    <p> The story in question: What happens when the sexually repressed teenage son of a sex therapist decides to start doling out some counseling of his own to his fellow high-schoolers? Otis (Butterfield) begins to explore that question at the behest of classmate Maeve (Emma Mackey), an intelligent young woman with a cultivated tough-girl exterior she uses to deflect some of the cruelties hurled at her by the other students. He’s encouraged in this by his best friend Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), an openly gay student whose eagerness to embrace life acts as a kind of armor of his own. What Otis lacks in sexual experience of his own, he makes up for in empathy and secondhand knowledge, the latter accrued over years of living with his mother Jean (Anderson). But as some of the many students who come to him for advice will learn, Otis also picked up his mother’s struggles with healthy communication and blind spots—issues with which his friends will become intimately and sometimes distressingly familiar. </p>

   <h3>  The Walking Dead </h3>

   <p>As I mentioned in my review of the previous “Walking Dead” spinoff “Dead City” months back, AMC’s flagship franchise must bristle in the wake of “The Last of Us”’s success over at HBO. With their newest spinoff, “Daryl Dixon,” the comparisons become even more inescapable: Pair a grizzled, traumatized zombie killer with a young child fated to usher in humanity’s future and send them on a lonely, dangerous quest to take said child to sanctuary. That’s “The Last of Us,” and it’s also “Daryl Dixon,” to a degree where Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog ought to speed-dial their copyright lawyers.  </p>

   <h3> The Housemaid</h3>

   <p>Seyfried is the star of the movie by a large margin, playing Nina’s unhinged behavior to almost horror movie absurdity. She puts on every half-cocked mean girl smile, every form of teary-eyed sobs, and unblinking rage with vicious ease, utterly washing out her too subtle to register costars. Sweeney seems to be sleepwalking through most of the film, completely changing into another character for its climactic finish and finally showing up to have some fun in the role. </p>
   
   <h3> Friend With Benefits </h3>

   <p>“Friends With Benefits” follows rom-com formulas as if directed on autopilot, but that’s not to say it isn’t fun. This is the second movie this year to ask whether it’s possible to have sex with someone without falling in love, and the second to arrive at a mistaken conclusion — because of course it is. It’s just not possible if you’re Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, and the audience likes you and demands a romantic fadeout. I propose this as a rule: No movie with big stars and a big budget can allow them to enjoy big-time sex and then split them up at the end. </p>
   
   <h3> 10 Things I Hate About You </h3>

   <p> “10 Things I Hate About You” is inspired, in a sortuva kinduva way, by Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew,” in the same sense that “Starship Troopers” was inspired by “Titus Andronicus.” It doesn’t remake Shakespeare so much as evoke him as a talisman, by setting its story at Padua High School, naming its characters Stratford and Verona, making one of the heroines a shrew, etc. There is even a scene where the shrew is assigned to rewrite a Shakespeare sonnet. </p>

   <h3> People We Meet On Vacation </h3>

   <p> Based on the wildly popular beach read of the same name by Emily Henry, “People We Meet on Vacation” is Netflix’s latest vapid attempt at reviving the rom-com genre. Told in a nonlinear format, we follow frenetic travel writer Poppy (Emily Bader) as she tries to get her groove back when her job is no longer fulfilling. We soon learn that the heart of the problem lies with her college best friend, the introverted Alex (Tom Blyth). Ever since meeting cute in college when Poppy joined Alex on a road trip from Boston College back to their hometown of Linfield, Ohio, one summer, the two have spent one week a year on vacation together, both unable to share how they really feel about each other. </p>

   <h3> The Break-Up </h3>

   <p> “The Break-Up” hints that the broken-up couple will get back together again, but that doesn’t make us eager for a sequel. The movie stars Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston as Gary and Brooke, a steady couple who have many reasons to break up but none to get together, except that they fall in love. Since the scenes where they’re together are so much less convincing than the ones where they fall apart, watching the movie is like being on a double-date from hell. </p>

   <h3> Fifty Shades Of Grey </h3>

   <p> At the end of “Fifty Shades Darker,” also directed by James Foley, the emotionally damaged Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), whose penthouse includes 1.) a sex-dungeon room with red leather walls and 2.) a pommel horse, proposed marriage to his virgin-turned-submissive-sex-partner Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). “Fifty Shades Freed” starts with the wedding. At first all is bliss, with a couple of kinks—sexually (what’s a honeymoon without handcuffs?) and emotionally (he doesn’t want her going topless on the beach). They are called back from their honeymoon because a bomb exploded in one of the “Grey Enterprises” warehouses. Security footage reveals the terrorist as Hyde (Eric Johnson), Anna’s former boss who sexually assaulted her at the first available opportunity. The lengths Hyde will go to to get revenge makes up just one of the many non-sexual plot-lines of “Fifty Shades Freed.” </p>
    
   <h3> Love Through A Prism</h3> 
   
   <p> RogerEbert.com contributor Jessica Ritchey wrote this unconventional but lovely piece about losing her father last year and working through his death and the aftermath through the prism of five movies: “Blackhat,” “Mad Max Fury Road,” “Crimson Peak,” “Creed,” and “Star Wars, Episode VII: The Force Awakens.” I am proud to present it here and I hope you find it as illuminating as I did, but you should be cautioned that she does discuss the ends of the films. This was inevitable and, I believe, correct, given that this piece is about the idea of life’s narrative coming to a close, and what that means for those left behind.–Matt Zoller Seitz</p>

   <h3> Zootopia </h3>

   <p>Fantasy films aimed at kids don’t have to have political messages, but when they do, they should either be internally consistent, or work through the contradictions in terms that kids can apply to the real world. “Zootopia,” a fantasy set in a city where predators and prey live together in harmony, is a funny, beautifully designed kids’ film with a message that it restates at every turn. But if you think about that message for longer than five minutes, it doesn’t merely fall apart, it invites a reading that is almost surely contrary to the movie’s seemingly enlightened spirit: discrimination is wrong, but stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason, and it’s not easy for members of a despised class to overcome the reasons why the majority despises them, so you gotta be patient. </p>
